# # What is Python Requests ?

# >>Python Requests is a python library used to get requests from the web pages.
# > Requests in Pyhton is a module which can be used to send all kinds of HTTP requests.
# It is very easy to use and has features like passing parameters in the URL and passing costom headers as well.
# It is a human friendly HTTP library as it also suggests on the official documentation page as well and it is one of the most downloaded python library with more than 400_000 downloads every day so you can imagine the popularity of python requests.
# It was written by Kenneth writes and has a license under Apache 2.O so this is all about python request.

# # Advanced Features of Python Requests:
# > Keep Alive & Connection Pooling
# > Elegant key/Value cookies
# > International Domains & URLs
# > Automatic Decompression
# > Sessions with Cookies Persistence
# > Unicode Response Bodies
# > Browser Style SSL Verification
# > HTTPs Peroxy Support
# > Automatic Content decodestring
# > Multipart File Uploads
# > Basic/Digest Authentication
# > Streaming Downloads
# > Connection Timeouts
# > Chunked Requests

# # Why use Python Requests?

# > Do not have to manually add query strings to URls, or formencode Post data.

# # Making GET Requests:
# > Get request is used to request the data from the server.

# > Syntax:
# import requests
# r=requests.get('url')
# #we will have a response object r.
# #print(r.text)

# # Making POST Requests:
# > Post request is used to submit the data to be processed to the server.
 
# >Syntax:
# import requests
# payload={key1:value1,key2:value2}
# r=requests.post('url',data=payload)
# #we will have a response object r.


# # Cookies And Headers:
# > We can view the servers headers using a python dictionary and similarly  access the cookies in the server as well. 
# print(r.headers)
# # r here is the response object.
# print(r.cookies)
# # r here is the response object.
# To send our own cookies,we can use the cookies parameter.


# # Session Objects:
# >The session object persists certain parameters over multiple requests.
# -persists cookies acroos all requests made from the session instance.
# -Use urllib3 connection pooling
# -Significant Performance Increase
# -A session Object has all the methods of the main requests API 


# # Errors And Exception:
# -In the event of the network problem,requests will raise a ConnectionError exception.
# -Response.raise_for_status() will raise an HTTP error when there is an unsuccessful status code.
# -if there is a timeout,it will raise a Timeout exception. 
# -TooManyRedirects exception is raised if the request exceeds the configured number of maximum number of redirections.
